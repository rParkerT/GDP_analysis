# üåç Socio-Economic Factors and Global Income Tiers (2022 Analysis)
## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between key socio-economic indicators and a country's economic status, using a robust dataset of global indicators for the year 2022. 
The primary goal was to determine whether non-GDP factors (such as life expectancy and literacy) could effectively predict a country's income group.

The analysis moves from basic data preparation through two distinct machine learning phases:

1. Regression: Predicting the continuous value of a country's GDP per Capita.

2. Classification: Predicting a country's discrete Income Group (Low, Lower-Middle, Upper-Middle, High) based on World Bank thresholds.


# Key Findings
| Model/Analysis                | Target                         | Performance             | Score  | Insigh                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression             | $\log(\text{GDP per Capita})$  | avg $\text{R}^2$ Score  | 0.70   | Socio-economic factors explain 70% of the variance in a country's wealth.          |
| Random Forest Classification  | Group Tier (0-3)               | Accuracy                | 60%    | The same factors are effective at placing a country into the correct income tier.  |




The regression model, with an average cross-validation R¬≤ of 0.70 explains a large portion of the variance in a country's wealth.
The same features are also effective in predicting a country's Income Group (classification), achieving an accuracy of 60%.
While the model is predictive, the 40% of misclassifications highlights the problem's inherent complexity. 
This suggests that the remaining variance is likely influenced by important unmeasured factors, such as political stability, institutional quality, or geographical resources.


## Data and Methodology
### 1. Data Preparation
<ul>
<li> Source: Global Economic Indicators (2019-2022).</li>
<li> Cleaning: Filtering for valid GDP data and handling missing values across all years using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.</li>
<li> Feature Engineering: Log Transformations were applied to highly skewed variables ($\text{GDP per Capita}$, $\text{Healthcare Spending}$) to stabilize variance and normalize distributions.</li>
<li> Categorization: Countries were divided into four economic tiers (Low, Lower-Middle, Upper-Middle, High) based on World Bank GNI thresholds applied to the GDP per Capita data.</li>
</ul>

### 2. Feature Selection
The final models were trained on the following features:
<ul>
<li> Life Expectancy</li>
<li> Fertility Rate</li>
</ul>

### 3. Modeling
| Model                    |Purpose                            | Key Steps                                                                                              |

| Linear Regression        |Continuous GDP prediction.         | Features scaled using StandardScaler; trained on log(GDP¬†per¬†Capita).
| Random Forest Classifier |Discrete Income Group prediction.  | Hyperparameter tuning was performed using Cross-Validation to select the optimal number of estimators. |
